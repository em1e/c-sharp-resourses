# C# Learning Path

## .NET Basics

## Learn HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
Course - The Complete Web Developer
Course - ASP.NET Core 6.0 Course - MVC - Blazor - Razor - EF Core

## Learn the MVC Pattern with Razor Pages
Course - SECTION 3 ONLY - ASP.NET Core 6.0 Course - MVC - Blazor - Razor - EF Core
Learning Path - Microsoft - MVC
Learning Path - Microsoft - Razor

## Learn about Entity Framework Core
There are two approaches to working with databases in EF Core:
1. Code first approach
2. Database first approach

*For developers, I highly recommend learning the code-first approach, as this is what most development teams use.*

Course - SECTION 6 ONLY - ASP.NET Core 6.0 Course - MVC - Blazor - Razor - EF Core
Learning Path - Microsoft - EF Core

## Learn How to Create Your Own API
In the course below, you will learn how to use Swagger to create an interface for your API so that you can test it.

Course - SECTION 7 ONLY - ASP.NET Core 6.0 Course - MVC - Blazor - Razor - EF Core
Learning Path - Microsoft - REST APIs

## Learn about Security and Authorization

Course - SECTION 8 ONLY - ASP.NET Core 6.0 Course - MVC - Blazor - Razor - EF Core
Learning Path - Microsoft

## Next Steps
At this point, you have some solid back-end skills. A logical next step is to ensure that you understand Razor pages well. If you do, and can modify them, then congratualtions! You can develop full-stack applications, especially after you've completed section Eight of the ASP.NET 6.0 Course. This is a huge first step. But to make yourself truly marketable, it is important to learn a popular library or framework.

### Learn React
In most cases, if you want to become a full-stack developer, the logical next step is to learn React. You can do that through Yihua Zhang's The Complete React Developer Course from Zero to Mastery. In Yihua's course, you will build an app with Firebase. I recommend going through Yihua's course and then, as a special challenge for yourself, rebuild the back-end with C# and SQL server and deploy that to Azure DevOps.

### Learn DSA in C#
Course - Andrei
Course - 

### Learn CI/CD and Microservices Architecture
After you've done that, to get yourself closer to a senior-level developer, you can do the following, in this order:
1. Learn about CI/CD and create build and release pipelines for your apps in Azure DevOps.
2. Learn about Microservices in C#.

*Note: It is perfectly valid to deploy to AWS instead of Azure DevOps, but most courses that cover C# will have you deploy to Azure DevOps. It is also a little easier for beginners, due to the GUI that Microsoft provides, but AWS is definitely more popular. If you want to learn AWS instead, you can take a look at this book: Developing on AWS with C# by Noah Gift and James Charlesworth*

## A Question You Might Ask
*Why are we skipping sections 4 and 5 in the C# course?* I'm glad you asked! The reason is that a number of large-scale applications are built with frameworks like Vue and Angular or with React (which is technically a library). As a full-stack software engineer, I am personally seeing much more demand for React skills than for Razor and Blazor. That said, it doesn't hurt to learn them so that you understand the trade-offs of using them versus a different framework.

In addition, the "headless" model is becoming more popular, but there are still plenty of apps that use MVC, and MVC is a great starting point to understand concepts like the separation of concerns.
